Even though I've lived to the blog era in the early 2000s, my first blogging experience is in 2022 as a PhD student... funny no?

Why are we here?
======
Well, my idea is to write mostly about the intersection between:
* Stuff that I find cool
* Stuff that I understand

This actually does not give me too many options. I may talk about hardware design, electronics, programming, music, a mix of them, or something completely different. Who knows? I actually have a few ideas, let's see if I will be able to organize myself to implement them! ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

Anyways, I won't make it so long. See you next time!
