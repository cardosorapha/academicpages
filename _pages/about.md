I am Raphael, a brazilian Electronics Engineer with a PhD in the field of Microelectronics and Photonics from Universit√© de Lyon, in the Institut of Nanotechnologies de Lyon. I received my B.E. degree at the Universidade Federal de Sergipe (Brazil) and had my Masters in the same institution. My research interests cover analog and mixed signal electronics, electronic instrumentation, and mathematical modeling of devices, circuits and systems.

I am currently part of the CI Inovador program in the analog & mixed signal track, happening in the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in a partnership with multiple brazilian and foreign companies.
