I am a PhD student at École Centrale de Lyon, in the Institut of Nanotechnologies de Lyon. I am currently working with professor Ian O'Connor (ECL/INL) and Sébastien Le Beux (Concordia) on photonic computing with phase-change materials at the [Heterogeneous Systems Design]([https://inl.cnrs.fr/](https://inl.cnrs.fr/en/heterogeneous-systems-design/)) group. I received my B.E. degree at the Universidade Federal de Sergipe (Brazil) and had my Masters in the same institution. My research interests cover emergent computing technologies and algorithms, analog computing, sensors and electronic instrumentation.
